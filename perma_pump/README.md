# Pump Setup Instructions

This guide is to set up the AD6i dosing pump array from Agrowtek. The pump array should ship with the AgrowLINK LX1 bridge device.

To install the pump array connect the USB cable from the LX1 device to your PC COM port and the ethernet cable from the LX1 device to the pump array as shown.

Once the pump is set up, go to the [Agrowtek downloads page](https://www.agrowtek.com/index.php/software), scroll to Link Modules, and download both the AgrowLINK and ModLINK utilities.
